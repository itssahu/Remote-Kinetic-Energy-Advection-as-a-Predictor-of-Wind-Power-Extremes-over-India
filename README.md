# Remote-Kinetic-Energy-Advection-as-a-Predictor-of-Wind-Power-Extremes-over-India
 The framework establishes a physically grounded pathway linking large-scale kinetic energy transport to wind power reliability under climate variability and change.

Fig. Schematic of the methodological framework outlining the workflow from ERA5 wind
and geopotential data to Kinetic Energy (KE) fields, EOF-based dimensionality reduction, and
regression modeling. The left branch represents intra-seasonal MW variability modeled using Ridge
Regression, and the right branch illustrates interannual TWh variability modeled using Elastic Net
and Multinomial Logistic Regression on Meta-EOFs.

Fig. EOF spatial pattern and PC time series for KE generation data over the Indian
subcontinent. X is the data matrix, ϕ1 the eigenvector explaining the largest variance fraction, and
z1 the projection of X onto the ϕ1 basis.
